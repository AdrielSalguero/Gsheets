# Gsheets

Hi ! On this code I catch dates from url. After I aplied ETL proccess, and upload to Gsheets.


## Goal !🎯

I needed to create a free DB for Data Studio and connect it from Google drive. Also, I have to automate this task, hence I use Deepnote tu run this code automatically at 
mornings. Is not the best solution, however at the moment solve problems.

## Tools! 🛠️

We have been worked with Gsheets APIs and Gdrive APIs, Python (Pandas and Datetime) and Deepnote.


Regards!
